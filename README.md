# DrinksWithAjax
An IntelliJ project created to utilize AJAX and Jquery in order to manage a list of drinks.

This project was created using AJAX, JQuery, CSS, Javascript, and HTML.

This was assignment 2 of a web development course offered at Texas State University. It was created for Dr. Visinescu in the Fall of 2019.

This website will accept user inputs to edit a list of drinks utilizing the AJAX functions of POST, GET, PUT & DELETE.

The objective of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with AJAX functions and using JQuery to identify elements in our website.
